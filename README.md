# Python Basics:

A program that, based on data collected from the user, i.e. the length of the sides, checks whether it is possible to build a triangle and whether it is a right triangle. If a triangle can be constructed, its perimeter and area should be printed, otherwise the triangle cannot be constructed.

# CONCEPTS: for loop, object, data type, method, list, nested conditional.
